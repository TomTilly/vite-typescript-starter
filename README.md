# Vite Typescript Starter

Basic starter for browser based Typescript projects. Includes ESLint + Prettier. Good for getting a quick playground environment setup.

## Getting Started

1. `cd` to the parent directory you want to initiate your project within
2. Run `npx degit TomTilly/vite-typescript-starter#main my-project`
3. Run `cd my-project`
4. Run `npm install`
5. (Optional) Remove `.vscode/settings.json` if you don't want my rules to override yours. Note that these settings, when combined with the recommended VS Code extensions, will provide integrated linting and formatting.
